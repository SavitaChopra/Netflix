The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for Netflix to optimize its content strategy, better cater to global audiences, and improve user experience.

📌 Objective
Perform EDA on Netflix's content to identify patterns, trends, and audience behavior.

International Movies and TV Shows are growing rapidly in popularity 🌍.
Genres like Drama, Action & Adventure, and Comedies are widely viewed globally.
Children’s content also continues to thrive on Netflix 🧸.
2️⃣ Target Audience 👥
A significant portion of Netflix's content targets Mature and Adult viewers, with content mainly rated TV-MA, TV-14, and TV-PG.
Around 20% of the content is aimed at younger audiences under 13 years old 🎒.
3️⃣ Regional Preferences 🌎
The United States dominates in terms of the variety and amount of Netflix content 🇺🇸.
India prefers family-friendly content and enjoys TV-PG and TV-14 ratings.
European audiences are increasingly gravitating toward non-English content, particularly foreign films 🎬.

Netflix can introduce regional-specific genres, similar to how Japanese Anime has become internationally popular 🌍.
Indian Mythological content is an untapped genre that could perform well globally, increasing both regional appeal and international interest.

India: Focus more on content targeting teenagers and young adults (14-35 years). This includes more family-friendly and TV-PG rated content 🍿.
European audiences: There’s a strong demand for foreign and non-English content, so Netflix should continue to invest in subtitled and dubbed movies and series 🎬.
3️⃣ Embrace Shorter Content ⏳
There is a growing demand for short-form content. Mini-series or movies with 75-150 minutes runtime are favored for quick binge-watching sessions 📺.
4️⃣ Leverage Data-Driven Insights 📊
By personalizing recommendations based on viewing patterns, ratings, and preferences, Netflix can enhance user engagement and satisfaction 📈.
🔚 Conclusion
